  
>Yet another Full-Stack Developer.<br>
>Yet another Life-Long Student.

Heyï¼ŒIâ€™m **YM (æ˜“æœ¨)**, a passionate Java developer who has recently embarked on this exciting journey in software engineering. This blog serves as a personal space to document my learning, share insights, and motivate myself to keep growing.

Beyond programming, I have a wide range of interests that keep me inspired and balanced. I enjoy DIY projects, reading, traveling and playing sports. These hobbies not only enrich my life but also provide fresh perspectives that I bring into my work.

This blog is built with inspiration from Hux Blog, and Iâ€™m deeply grateful for the detailed tutorials provided by Hux. Back in my student days, I experimented with setting up personal blogs on cloud servers and wrote numerous articles. However, for convenience and practicality, I eventually chose to build this blog using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). My goal is to summarize knowledge from various domains and continuously improve myself.

##### Why This Blog?

This blog is more than just a collection of posts; itâ€™s a reflection of my journey as a developer and a lifelong learner. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and hope that my experiences can inspire or help others in their own paths. Whether itâ€™s a technical deep dive, a personal story, or a simple tip, I aim to create content that adds value to the community.

###### Whatâ€™s Next?

As I continue to grow, I plan to explore more advanced topics in software development and AI, contribute to open-source projects, and expand my skill set. Stay tuned for updates, and letâ€™s grow together!

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to connect or discuss anything! Iâ€™m always open to exchanging ideas and learning from others.
